# Automatic artboard placement for the meticulous

This Sketch plugin automatically places the first artboard of a page at the specified origin (currently 0, 0).

Makes use of the undocumented ArtboardChanged Action; curretly broken after the first page of a document.

#### Future

- Add padding to the rect for zoomToFit.
- Fix page selection for documents with >1 page.
- Allow user to set a custom origin through the menu.
